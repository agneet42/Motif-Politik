Now, that wish has been granted, for Royal Enfield has unveiled the Classic 500 and 350 in Delhi. For a price of Rs 98,000, ex-showroom, Delhi, the 350 is much cheaper than we anticipated, while the Classic 500 at Rs 1.24 lakh is another steal. If you're wondering what powers the 350, well, there are no prizes for guessing that the mill from the Thunderbird Twinspark would be the answer.The Classic features timeless old school styling with a healthy dosage of new-age technology. Fuel injection is being offered on the Bullet for the first time ever in the country and power and torque figures have improved too. For the 350, power has gone up from 18 bhp to 19.8 bhp, while torque has actually gone down to 2.9 kgm from 3.3 kgm. Relaxed and comfortable cruising at over 100 kph all day is now a distinct possibility.With the 500, power has gone up to 27.2 bhp from 22 bhp, while torque now stands at 4.2 kgm.The wheel rims on the Classic have shrunk to 18-inch jobs from 19-inchers. That gives you the freedom to choose from a larger variety of tyres that are made of that size, besides changing the gearing. Born like a gun. Goes like a Bullet. Amen.","1403","8085","","0","UPDATED: The Enfield Classic now roars!","39","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","69372","502","4.2914186","1","9","65","6","18ff7c75373dd3f387a9ac52e33b4783","0.089","",""

"https://royalenfield.com/motorcycles/classic-350/media-review-details/?id=33","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Royal Enfields compared - Bullet proof","38","306","Which bullet would you shoot yourself with? Here are your optionsWelcome to British Iron Roulette. First, a few facts: 1. Every two minutes there’s a Bullet rider pushing his broken-down bike up a lonely road. 2. There’s usually enough oil on a Bullet’s engine for the USA to consider attacking it. 3. Bullets make their riders go weak in the knees – through endless frustrating kicks. 4. Contact Breaker points break more hearts than points. 5. Finding true happiness with a Bullet is like finding the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. 5. Bullet riders seem to find it. To them, it’s a fairytale that never ends. The new UCE Bullets have been around for a while now, and are said to change all of this – except that last part, of course. The soul of the old engine without any of its ‘quirks’, it’s said. Change, it seems, is inevitable – even for Royal Enfields. What’s more, they’re even said to be reliable and easy to maintain. Naturally, die-hard Bulleteers are outraged at this sacrilege that makes life easier for them and attracts riders of other ‘lesser’ motorcycles into their fold. I, however, welcome any change that makes REs easy to live with and decided to verify that claim. Why? Because a ’75 350 has owned me since before I was born. Let’s get down to the shooting, shall we?Bullet 350The Bullet is perhaps the motorcycle closest to my heart. So, it’s only natural that I rode it the most. For this one, the cogs of time ground to a halt in the ’50s. Even with the new engine, it manages to look suitably old-fashioned. Old-timers, the actual ones as well as the old at heart, will feel overwhelming sadness at the absence of the gear lever on the right side and the neutral finder. Their eyes will be tearful as they hear the increased mechanical clatter of the new motor. But when they ride it for three days in heavy rain without so much as a splutter, they will see the new-found reliability. They will gasp in amazement at how it feels so much lighter than the older one, even though it still weighs 180 kg. Their rattled bones will thank the new motor for its smoothness. And every time they open the tank, they will be shocked to see the amount of fuel left in it. The Bullet proves to be an easy-going and friendly motorcycle. And the best part is, nothing else has changed. That headlight nacelle still looks bloody beautiful. The front drum evokes equal proportions of nostalgia and white knuckles when you try to stop in a hurry. Ride quality is still excellent. Even though the power has increased from 18 bhp to 19.8 bhp, it still feels the same as before – which is around 4 bhp. Long story short, it still is a Bullet. It’s not the same, but it’s as close as you can get to the original one. Even the tank is still pinstriped by hand by a third-generation Bullet tank painter. His grandfather must’ve painted my bike’s tank. Some day, I shall ride my bike to the factory and meet him. The Bullet is dead. Long live the Bullet. PS: The CB points may have left the building, but the thump still lives. Just as soon as you’ve replaced that damned exhaust. Gun Match: Chrome six-shooterElectra TwinsparkThe Electra probably should’ve been honourably discharged in the last decade. But I suppose there are motorcyclists who don’t want to see the world through a sepia tint, but want the thump following them around anyway. It looks fresher than the Bullet, though I still associate the Electra with the early noughties; I wanted a silver one back then. I still do. I think it is certainly the most comfortable Enfield to ride – the ’bar is nice and high, while the seat is stepped just right. Gas-charged rear shocks make ride quality even better, while a front disc keeps your blood pressure low. For those who want a comfortable Bullet, this is it. PS: A good all-rounder. But not as evocative as the Bullet. Or as desirable as the Classic. Gun Match: Service revolverThunderbird TwinsparkAt some point, RE decided to give in to the ‘enthusiast’s’ perceptions – that RE is the H-D of India – and make this anomaly (Kyle can’t pronounce that word, by the way – he says alimony). Every time I see one of these, I can feel the ghost of Redditch turning in its grave. Bullets are meant to be dignified and charming Brits, not wannabe lazy Americans. Okay, it sells well, but I think it’s the most ungainly Enfield of them all - that ICBM exhaust really doesn’t help matters any. It is also comfortable and all of that, but I won’t let that distract me either.PS: I’ve a feeling that I wouldn’t be so mad at the Thunderbird if RE made a scrambler and a cafe racer alongside it. Then I could just ignore it, no? Gun Match: Single-shot pistol. Make that single-shot water pistol Classic 350Has got to be the best-looking Enfield made since they landed on Indian shores way back in the 1949. Um, the 500 too, that means. Just the way it looks is enough for me to start considering EMI options. Apparently, this aptly named Enfield is the one that gets the most attention in an RE showroom. And why not? With the optional upswept exhaust that flows more freely and a smaller diameter 18-inch rear, this version has the right sound and additional performance over the Bullet, the Electra and the Thunderbird. However, the rider’s seat is still a bit too flat to provide any reassuring support to your backside. And that optional pillion seat really mars those classic lines. I surely wouldn’t fit one. And then proceed to ride around with pillion footpegs sans the seat. And again, the front 19-incher is a ribbed pattern tyre – not cool for hard braking and hard cornering, no matter how many hardened Bulleteers swear by it. Just fit a better one, RE! But when it comes to build quality, thanks to the two Classics, all the other Enfields can again claim to be built like guns too. RE has got it very right with the Classic and I hope they go on to better things. Like a scrambler and a cafe racer, for instance. PS: Give us a long-termer, RE. Gun Match: S1860 Colt Army Model Classic 500500 is a nice number, no? It makes your heart race and your spine tingle (yes, it’s the vibes), and makes for a genuine hot rod of a motorcycle, I tell you. A fusion of pure beauty and brute power without peer. I’ve never seen that familiar speedo needle nail those numbers with as much aggression as on the C500. What’s even better is the way it feels like a direct descendant of the older cast-iron engine, more so than the 350 UCE – even the kick requires as much effort as the older ones! That 4.21 kgm of torque strains at the leash in your right hand. More often than not, it succeeds in breaking free. And then it runs wild until you’re left with the biggest pushrod buzz you can get this side of a locomotive. Adding to the involvement is a flaw – the front tyre is an 18-incher as opposed to the 350’s 19-incher, and that makes the front weave at anything above 90 kph. Even the stickier tyre doesn’t help. Also, even though that fuel injection system works pretty well, I’d prefer a carb feeding that stonking motor, just so I could fiddle with it no end. Despite these two niggles, the Classic 500 is a motorcycling experience that none should be deprived of. Looking at it elicits loving sighs. Plugging the throttle provokes adrenaline-fuelled howls. I can imagine going off on a long ride and alternating between the two until I run out of road. Though I’ve never ridden the original performance Enfields (the Meteors, Super Meteors and Constellations), I know that this one is the spiritual successor to them all. Now RE, give us the twins we’ve been waiting for. PS: The others might be subjective, but this is a true Royal Enfield for everyone. Sigh. Gun Match: 500 Smith & Wesson MagnumThe parting shotMy Bullet takes me back, in spite of not having been born then, to a time when the first propeller-powered planes took to the unexplored skies. A time when the only electric things around were CB-point ignitions and lightning. It’s a firm cast-iron, 350cc upper cut to the ‘progress’ that time has wreaked upon us.It’s been said that a Bullet’s tickover is the mechanical rendition of the human heartbeat. The only thing a child hears in its mother’s womb is her heartbeat. Then, it is born and soon it hears the thump of a Bullet, and it is drawn by an instinctive affection to that sound. An affection that’s been formed even before it was born. It doesn’t stand a chance. The story of every Bullet rider, it’s said. No wonder the number of people who want Bullets has never waned. Even more so today, when the forbidding reputation of older Bullets is being rapidly overhauled by these new Enfields. Okay, the gear lever’s on the wrong side and CB points have long disappeared. But a Bullet is still a Bullet. You open your heart to it and let it own you, sometimes even before you are born. And even though the new generation of Royal Enfields have made a move towards becoming more acceptable and to conform with current-day standards, they remain a happy escape, a release from the efficiency-propounding life that living in today’s world is. And notice that I didn’t even once say ‘character’.

Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 500cc gives, according to local brand showroom of RE, 32-35 kmpl of mileage with electronic fuel injection system while Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 350cc is supposed to give 40-45 kmpl of fuel economy.Low fuel efficiency of Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 500cc is mainly due to higher engine capacity of the bike. On the other hand, Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 350cc gives more mileage on account of unit construction engine and lower engine capacity as compared to Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 500cc.Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 Pick upThe bikes, Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 500cc and Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 350cc, comes loaded with unit construction engine and the mill is designed for better performance and comfort. The pick-up and acceleration are upgraded in the new machines as against the predecessors. The top speed of Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 500cc is 130 kmph.Colors of Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350The siblings are available in three attractive body colours. Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 500cc comes in red, black and sky blue while Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 350cc is available in red, black and silver shades. It means that red and black shades are common whereas sky blue is a standard colour for Classic 500. Silver comes in only Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 350cc. In both the new products, body colour is there on front and rear fender, fuel tank, mask, air filter box and utility box. Engine, silencer, rear fork, rear view mirrors and legguard are in silver shade for both motorcycles.Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 LooksIf you want to ride a vintage cum latest bike, Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 is here for the guys like you as it is a perfect and well-designed blend of vintage and advanced bike. It is to be mentioned here that the design of the bike is borrowed from post world war II era. The engineers of the Royal Enfield visited British National Motorcycle Museum in Coventry to copy the parts of the old legend. The new Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 can be differentiate by front disc brake, number plate and tool box and the rest of the things remained the same multi spoke rim, like front and rear mudguards, single saddle seat, silencer, fuel tank, air filter box and leg guard.As far as graphics are concerned, the new bike possesses the same Classic fonts at fuel tank. But yes, classic 500 and 350 sticker are new at air filter box but fuel tank logo. Body colour is painted on fuel tank, front and rear fender, air filter box, utility box and mask. A transparent company's sticker is also pasted at the top of fuel tank. For the first time in Royal Enfield history, Royal Enfield's initials are carved at engine. Apart from the initials, Twinspark EFI 500 and Twinspark 350 are also inscribed at the engines. This time headlight is covered by a steel cap over it. The headlight houses a clear halogen bulb for better visibility. A classic number plate is also a vintage sign. The tail side of the bike is also in classic shape with brake light in centre. Bold and heavy turn indicators are fitted at the both end of the machine. The Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 350 boasts of a traditional analogue instrument panel. The dashboard finds its place at the headlamp casing. There are mainly two dial-pods with ignition key hole. The dashboard is comprised of Speedometer and fuel gauge. The speedometer comes in larger shape at the centre while fuel gauge at right side of the console. The single saddle seat just look like a bicycle seat with open springs that ensure ultimate comfort. Passenger seat can be added to the bike. In the same way, silencer of the bike can be altered when off-road journey.

A ride reveals more. Royal Enfield first launched its Thunderbird cruiser in 2002. And the latest variant of the Thunderbird 500 was first seen at this year’s Indian Auto Expo. We’ve recently ridden the latest T’bird on the Bangalore-Ooty highway to bring you this first impression. An immediately visible change is a new headlight featuring a projector lamp. Stylish new instruments display an analogue speedometer and tachometer, with a digital display including a clock also in place. The new grips feel decent and both control levers have a solid, meaty feel to them. A hazard warning switch is standard, making for a Royal Enfield first. The fuel tank is larger, well-proportioned with its filler lid offset at the top. And you now have the option of removing the pillion seat to increase luggage room. The 500 also gets a revised exhaust, LED tail-lamp and RE logos for its foot pegs.","986","5557","","0","Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500 first ride, review","48","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","71660","451","4.1585817","2","14","70","7","85c70a4c1ca8f44639b0d0f2b95edb4f","0.624","",""

The iconic manufacturer of the Bullet is now going flat out with monthly numbers of 10,000 motorcycles. By mid-2013, the company will also have in place its new plant in Oragadam near Chennai. Lal spoke to Business Line about the changes at Royal Enfield and the road ahead. A lot of hard work went into this, right from sorting out production, quality and suppliers to getting the right dealers, attitude, service, showrooms and products. The Classic was an important trigger. The reasons why someone did not buy an Enfield bike earlier have vanished with the Classic. Till then, people had all kinds of reservations about Enfield. Read More here:","760","4382","","0","Ride the Thunderbird, leave your worries behind","47","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","70020","412","3.95498","2","14","70","7","6368bd5a60827df8d6896cded969987a","0.063","",""

But they’d be dead wrong. Classically styled and nostalgia fuelled they might be, but the boffins at Royal Enfield have slowly, but steadily, modernising the motorcycles they make, at this juncture they probably offer a very interesting mix of old world and new in a way nobody has really done so far.

"https://royalenfield.com/motorcycles/classic-chrome/media-review-details/?id=122","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Finally, a bike that really is built like a gun and goes like a bullet","70","505","Jumping onto Royal Enfield's latest chromed slug, designed to replace the Machismo, this Bullet feels fast right from the word go. The Classic Chrome 500's acceleration is punchy with the torque coming in a torrent, so much so that whipping open the throttle actually pushes you back violently - not very different from a muscle bike. If the 500cc air cooled UCE lump of an engine wasn't wrapped in retro Classic Chrome, it could be right at home on a small capacity muscler.The fuel-injected 500cc unit construction engine, which Royal Enfield got Italy's Engines Engineering to design and build, is the strongest point of the whole package. Outputting over 27 horses and a mammoth 42Nm of peak torque, the Bullet finally lives up to the reputation of its tagline ""Built Like a Gun, Goes like a Bullet"". After dispatching nought to sixty in under five seconds, you'll be hurtling past the ton mark in just over 10 seconds (if you keep her pinned that is). Its top speed is about 130kph, with 140 being registered on the analog speedometer.There is plenty of torque everywhere in the rev range and the copious torque is what this motorcycle is all about. The vibes though, make their presence felt at two points of the rev range. The first set is at speeds of 60kph, where the typical single cylinder resonance tingles your palms. The next is at the top of the rev range at about 120kph, after which the engine smooths down near the top speed. An endearing factor of the Classic Chrome is that the throttle response is crisp and very un-Bullet like, all credit to the fuel injection system that brings a modicum of modernity to what is otherwise a retro looking motorcycle. The thump though is subdued by the long Bazooka exhaust. Naturally, the shorter bottle muffler is what will be the first accessory that Classic Chrome owners would resort to and that takes care of the all important thump.A clean response throughout while revving is what Royal Enfield has engineered into this motorcycle after some jerking concerns on the first few batches of Classic 500s. The high speed fishtailing issue too has been sorted out with a revised suspension layout that dumps the offset front forks for a more conventional design. Handling, though slightly heavy at lower speeds, is very stable and the 187-kilo Classic Chrome actually loves long sweepers and twisted sections of tarmac as long as the biker takes it easy and doesn't indulge in histrionics that would feel just right with smaller capacity, lighter motorcycles.The Classic Chrome represents the secret sauce that Royal Enfield finally seems to have gotten right with the 500cc unit construction engine, stuff which is the most potent part of the whole package. This vastly improved flagship thumper as compared to their earlier UCE500s, commands an ex-showroom price of over Rs1.65 lakh.  The Classic Chrome 500 is a motorcycle that both you and your granddad would be very happy thumping about on.

"https://royalenfield.com/motorcycles/classic-chrome/media-review-details/?id=102","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","The sands of time","17","143","The Classic Chrome and Desert Storm offer everything a Royal Enfield does, and moreEver since the Classic series was launched in November 2009, Royal Enfield has had to face a bevy of orders. The series translated to superb demand that, very often, far outstripped the supply. Not one to bow down to pressure, the Indian Marquee has now launched two limited edition bikes in the Classic series – the Desert Storm and Classic Chrome. The Chennai-based manufacturer has increased capacity substantially, but patrons of the veteran motorcycle maker are still bearing with long waiting periods. Royal Enfield has just rolled out its latest and we grabbed the opportunity to get astride the heavy metal thumpers on desolate Jaisalmer highways. The gleaming spokes, chrome-rimmed wheels and flowing, steel mudguards are in line with the retro aura that's been the big draw and highlight to Royal Enfield motorcycles. The Desert Storm's matte sand colour does well to embellish this and the bike looks all the better for it. The Classic Chrome, in comparison, uses dual-tone shades of chrome with maroon, or black, smart and broad stripes running along the length of its mudguards. Metal-encased telescopic forks lead to a bright, hooded headlight, sticking out from a Royal Enfield trademark steering head. Instruments are familiar bits: the basic analogue Royal Enfield fare with a speedometer reading up to 160kph. A fuel gauge is missing but you do get a reserve warning icon. Circular, chrome mirrors look the part but vibrate a fair bit when riding and hamper rearview vision. We've always recommended buffed alloy levers and the new models also have rider-friendly soft and comfortable palm grips. The switchgear, which packs all the essentials, works positively and both Enfields come equipped with strident twin horns, a well-deserved bonus for these highway friendly motorcycles. The latest Classics use teardrop fuel tanks with the Royal Enfield logo emblazoned in an aptly regal font. An old-fashioned chrome tank cap and knee-pads — on the Desert Storm — lend a period touch to the bikes as do the tool and air boxes on the flanks. Hogging the limelight of course is the large, naked engine which displays good attention to detail, with crankcase blisters inspired by the Spitfire fighter aircraft of World War II. The spring-mounted riding saddle that was part of the original Classic has been improved with revised, stiffer springs that kept us better connected to the motorcycle. Both the Desert Storm and Classic Chrome get uncluttered rear sections, their smoothly flowing mudguards leading to the tail-light. While overall quality and finish do seem slightly improved, they still lag behind the tall standard of modern Indian motorcycles. This new Classic duo come with an improved, 499cc, air-cooled, four-stroke and single-cylinder new-generation Royal Enfield engine. Twin spark-plugs and Keihin fuel injection are carry-forwards from the original Classics, as are twin valves and long-stroke engine architecture that fit this character-rich motorcycle perfectly. The piston assembly is superior, and mapping has been revised while much else remains constant including hydraulic tappets, a drive-chain tensioning system and the peak power figure of 27.2bhp at 5250rpm. 4.2kgm of max torque is delivered at 4000rpm. The big single starts at the push of a button, with its charging circuit now beefed up. As expected, the Limited Edition Classics drum out a lazy, healthy and loud beat Indians have long admired and appreciated. Pushing hard in the quest for brisk performance is pointless on these motorcycles, with unhurried riding pleasure the way to go while cautiously short-shifting through the one-down, four-up pattern, mechanical-feeling gearbox. Holding cruising speeds of up to 110kph is effortless, beyond which the Classics can still be pushed but riding pleasure severely deteriorates. The power spread is wide, with an ample low and mid-range yours for the asking. The heavy Classics provide decent throttle response and a lazy, rhythmic feel that Royal Enfields are renowned for. Performance is much the same as earlier, the Desert Storm and Classic Chrome zipping past 60kph in around four seconds, while mustering a true top speed of 130kph. The Classic Chrome and Desert Storm weigh 187kg, their single-downtube, heavy tubular steel frames reaching from a bulky steering clamp to the engine, while an archaic, tubular, bush-mounted swingarm attaches to the rear wheel and twin adjustable gas-filled shock absorbers. There's been much change in the front, where 130mm travel-telescopic front forks now run in the same line as the front wheel axle. Trail is increased to 101mm, and the front wheel is now 19 inches, even as the rear remains 18 inches shod by a larger 120/80 section tyre. The Classics have a comfortable and commanding upright riding posture, and the newly sprung seat is certainly a big improvement. Royal Enfield bikes are known for not sacrificing much handling despite a full payload, and this duo maintains that reputation. Straightline stability is always rock-solid, and these Classics go around corners with a planted feel. Steering feel is heavier than ideal but neutral and precise, with good ride quality keeping the rider comfortable over most road surfaces. Brake feel is more reassuring now, thanks to the new front suspension with a 280mm disc in the front and a 153mm drum unit at rear. While it is true that these two new models represent the best of what Royal Enfield has to offer, a swiftly evolving two-wheeler market is proving to be a stringent test to veteran motorcycle makers. Undeniably, the Classic series has come a long way from the models released two years ago, but RE must step up the pace of improvement, whilst retaining its old world charm and charisma. It won't be long before this very capable Indian manufacturer faces stiff competition from able cruiser rivals — most notably, Harley Davidson — who prepare to launch their wares in India.

Royal Enfield Classic Chrome & Desert Storm","53","473","Priced at Rs 1.64 lakh and Rs 1.58 lakh respectivelyRoyal Enfield has launched two cosmetic upgrades to its Classic 500. The Classic Chrome, as the name suggest comes with plenty of chrome on the motorcycle and is priced at Rs 1.64 lakh, on road, Mumbai. The Desert Storm has a sandy hue and comes priced at Rs 1.58 lakh, on road, Mumbai.While these two motorcycles sport only cosmetic changes, this is the thought process behind their styling. We've cabbaged it off the Royal Enfield website:The Royal Enfield Classic Chrome is based on the Classic 500 with a rather generous dose of chrome on it. Like the Classic 500, the new Classic Chrome retains the quintessential classic British styling of the 1950s: simple, harmonious, well proportioned. The Chrome sports a seat with a leather finish and adds to the visual appeal of the motorcycle. Built of old-fashioned metal, in clean elegant lines of Chrome combined with a rich paint finish the design of the Royal Enfield Classic Chrome is a tribute to the retro look of post war British motorcycles.The Classic Desert Storm comes to you with a “sand” paint scheme reminiscent of the war era, a time when Royal Enfield motorcycles proved their capabilities and battle worthiness by impeccable service to soldiers in harsh conditions of the desert. Donning a younger today resplendent with styling cues one would expect only from a genuine Royal Enfield: single cylinder air-cooled pushrod engine, 1950s style nacelle and toolboxes, traditional paint scheme and buffed engine components, this motorcycle is all set to bring you the pleasures of modern motorcycling while reflecting the aura of eternal classic styling.","1668","9674","","0","LAUNCHED!

A war-inspired model that is quite a rare offering to come by for Indian riders these days, the 500cc power-packed machine could pump pride and envy even into the hearts current RE bike owners. The birth of the Royal Enfield Classic models was in November 2009, and they stormed the market, carving a niche especially for those vintage motorcycle lovers with an inclination for the fine mix of classic design and modern mechanicals. Now, true to its name, the new RE motorcycle rakes up a storm with its tweaked features and pulsating performance. For someone who has been riding the RE Standard Bullet for more than six years, the Classic experience a few years ago was the equivalent of a maiden trip to New Zealand and now the Desert Storm gives the adrenaline rush of a bungee jump in Queenstown. Apart from being a unique variant in terms of the skin being inspired by desert sand, the battle-ready Classic Desert Storm is an upgraded version of the iconic RE Classic, which could be your perfect ride to your office and also hold its own on rugged terrain to keep entertained even on off days. War inspired The Bullet has inspired generations of Indians and expats to attempt customisation. The brand's macho, rugged image and its association with the armed forces are legendary. Many owners including yours truly have had a history of enduring an exasperating wait for an army matte green paint job for their RE bikes. I remember finally giving up after my own attempts at getting a local painter to deliver the results I desired bore bitter fruit. The quest for an apt font and accessories to get the so-called look ‘with pride of combat' added to the ire back then. So, it is an impressive effort by the designers at the Royal Enfield factory in Tiruvottiyur, near Chennai to have thought of a model inspired by war – a theme with a lot of relevance for this bike. The matte-finish sand colour paint job, the conventional stickers and rubber pads on the tank and the spring saddle seats identical to the older Classics provides the epic touch to the new model. The sense of pride in riding home a war model is something many may ridicule but the looks and thump of the Classic Desert Storm will silence critics. Having rolled out the Battle Green version as well, RE can look at introducing some military-inspired merchandise to pep-up the ride for fans like me. And also variants of the saddle seat could quench the thirst for a much newer look on the new machine. Tweaked engine The Desert Storm is based on the same platform as the RE Classic and is also loaded with the same 500cc Twin Spark unit construction engine. The long stroke mill, which is powered by a Japanese-made Keihin Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system, can churn out a good 27.2 bhp of power at 5,250 rpm and 41.3 Nm of peak torque at 4,000 rpm. The amazing part about this 499cc engine is the fact that its refinement level has improved despite it continuing to be a single cylinder, air-cooled pushrod unit. Of course new technology has contributed to the improvement. The new Desert Storm will feel much more approachable for eager new buyers coming into the RE fold. The classic feel of a bullet with its addictive, leisurely performance is there, but with the loads of torque available, the Desert Storm can also quickly spool up and spring forward when the rider demands it. Built into the crankcase, is the five-speed constant mesh gearbox which has already been in the news for improving the performance in the Classic 500. The smooth shifts that it affords and the fact that it perfectly complements the new engine mapping for the Desert Storm won me over all over again. For those deceived by the retro looks of this motorcycle, the fact that it clocks speeds of 100 kmph to 120 kmph with ease, making it capable of challenging any latest motorcycle of its class out there on the road for a ‘drag', can come as a shocker. The buffed, shiny engine, the 1950s-style nacelle and toolbox, and the swept upwards short silencer (which is an optional fitment) are all extremely eye-catchy additions in the engine area. These features and the subtle matt paint work had many onlookers drooling over my test bike. Opening up the throttle and letting the sonorous thump of the exhaust wake up the neighbourhood invoked even more envious stares. Ride and handling There has always been a certain charm to the Bullet's vulnerable rigidity. I am sure many enthusiasts would have loved some of the previous RE bikes' whimsical on-road manners and their relatively unreliable parts. While the new Classics continue to be put together with as much passion, their glorious uncertainty is now part of history. New electricals, switchgear, electrical self-start, combined engine and gearbox parts, EFI and even more rigid components like the new front forks, make the new Classic Desert Storm as reliable and refined as any in the segment. The new front fork suspensions have been modified compared to the older Classic model to improve rigidity and provide more refined handling. The result is that the Desert Storm also offers much better riding comfort and enhanced braking. There is no feeling of pitchy or late reacting brake performance. Minor adjustments to the rake and trail of the front suspension provide comfortable handling especially on bumpy roads. Coming to the key element of the ride, the Desert Storm is clearly the upgraded version of the older classic bearing the spring saddle seats and Bullet fans will love it. Zipping through a traffic bottleneck in the city has been never easy with a big Bullet, but the Classic variants manage to do just that. The gearshifts are smooth, with false neutrals being almost non-existent. The new Storm takes the experience of riding a muscular RE to a new high. And the best part is that it manages to marry tech with the flavour of the Classics of yore. The famous Tiger's eye headlamp now features a Halogen bulb, the original unit construction engine now has electronic fuel injection and the familiar speedometer with Classic English font now has a EFI warning lamp integrated into it. The new Royal Enfield Classic Desert Storm offers a mileage of 20 to 25 kmpl (depending to road conditions) and can be your own for Rs. 1,43,967 (ex-showroom, Mumbai). To update the Classic range, RE has also launched the new Chrome edition in the classic red and black colour options, with chrome being the dominant finish for the theme. Running on the fuel tank, the wide mud guards and the toolbox, the chrome finish gives the new variant ‘blingy' looks that many will fall in love with.

That is what comes to my mind whenever I think of classic motorcycles. A name that is synonymous to the word classic is 'Royal Enfield'. For years, this motorcycle manufacturer has made bikes like the Bullet 350 and the Bullet 500 that have great nostalgic value for the hardcore motorcycling community. Moving forward with the same enthusiasm and commitment towards its loyal customers, RE (Royal Enfield) has recently launched two new versions of the Classic 500. Unlike the Classic 500, the new bikes that are in production are called Classic Chrome and Classic Desert Storm. As the names suggest the Classic Chrome features a new Chrome fuel tank, while the Desert Storm has a matte finish applied to the entire body save for the engine of the bike. Both models house a 500cc TwinSpark engine, which in my view was brilliant in terms of its performance as it belted out 27.2 bhp. For me the Classic Desert Storm will always be the first choice as its matte paint is pretty striking to the naked eye compared to the Chrome bling, which is the norm for any Enfield..","1124","6539","","0","Classic Royalty","15","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","72305","479","4.2672973","3","12","70","7","cf93239dd1cf84dd0c086370fb9d75fa","0.055","",""

"https://royalenfield.com/motorcycles/classic-desert-storm/media-review-details/?id=121","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Royal Enfield Desert Storm","26","216","I consider myself somewhat of a Royal Enfield technology evangelist, more so since I just sold my Machismo LB500 weeks ago after experiencing the motorcycle for over a couple of years, across varied terrains. Every other day, we have a series of queries on IndianCarsBikes’ comments/Ask Experts section, asking for advice whether the new UCE engined Bullets are better than the cast iron or AVL engined ones and more often that not, I find myself directing the eager answer seekers to our comparison story, comparing the Cast Iron, AVL and UCE engines.In a nutshell, UCE engines are vastly better than both CI and AVL engines, and no there are no two things about that. But if you want to read about my experience on a brand new Royal Enfield Desert Storm 500 for close to 1,000 kilometers in a no-holds-barred ICB comprehensive road test, you must hit the jump.I got astride a brand new Royal Enfield Desert Storm 500, on a surprisingly hot for November, Mumbai morning, with 61 kilometers on the Desert Storm’s clock. Before the odometer read 70 kilometers, I was doing a heady 120 Kph on the Desert Storm 500, throwing caution to the wind. And no, I wasn’t stranded with a seized or struggling engine even after close to 1000 kilometers of ham fisting.  Would I have indulged in such antics on a new cast iron Bullet or even say, an AVL engined Bullet? Hell no, would be my straight answer. But the confidence that the UCE engine gives a rider is something that both a dyed-in-the-wool bulleteer as well as Royal Enfield newbie would revel in.That the Unit Construction Engine designed by Engines Engineering of Italy is the strongest part of the package, would be an understatement.  This engine is what is selling Royal Enfields by the truckloads with the ancient Royal Enfield factory struggling to meet the ever increasing demand, it is only fitting that the UCE engine is the prime focus of this road test, as much as the overall Desert Storm package is. The high amount of vibrations were a little disconcerting on the Desert Storm that I was riding but with barely 61 kilometers on the odo, I attribute the vibes to the fresh engine that requires some breaking in to settle down.As I clocked more and more kilometers, the engine became noticeably smoother although the vibes at idle were noticeably higher than my LB500 or even say a cast iron 500. While the UCE engine is definitely on the noisy side, this is due to the high idle speed that the engine runs on, often close to 1,300 rpm. Lower that by two hundred rpm or so and you’ll have a much more silent engine. Good friend Lijo of Overdrive, had ridden all the way from Mumbai to Goa on a Classic Chrome 500 and I jumped saddle to gauge why the Desert Storm I was riding felt vibey. Lijo’s Classic Chrome 500 felt noticeably smoother. Two factors were responsible for this. One: Lijo’s motorcycle had clocked over 2000 kms. Two: Lijo’s motorcycle still ran the long bazooka muffler instead of the upswept bottle muffler than my Desert Storm featured.The upswept muffler, while giving rise to some vibes, especially at idle and the top of the rev range, also seems to liberate a pony or two, as I experienced with the distinctly quicker acceleration of the block and quicker response during roll on speeds. Oh, so I was finally in Goa enjoying the winter sun, er, there are only two weathers in Goa, warm and hot. In a warm Goa in November, the Desert Storm 500 felt just at ease, with the narrow Goan roads actually proving to be a hoot to ride on. I wouldn’t be this confident on say the Electra 350 or even the Thunderbird TBTS, but the Desert Storm with its low seat delivered great handling around the narrow Goan alleys.Although heavy to turn in, speeds of over 60 give the Desert Storm 500 a poise and agility that its other cousins will ind hard pressed to match. I encountered none of the high speed weave when I was ham fisting the Desert Storm on the NH4 on my way to Pune, enroute Goa. So, Royal Enfield has indeed worked on correcting the swing arm troubles that the early Classic 500s were prone to and the Desert Storm was rock steady at an indicated 135 Kph I achieved on a slightly downhill section just below the Khambatki Ghat on NH4, and the motorcycle was rock steady with absolutely no weaving or instability of any sort. The change in behavior may be attributed to the offset on the front forks being done away with and this seems to have made a huge difference in high speed handling.That said, the Desert Storm 500 feels best at speeds of 100-110 Kph, when the thump becomes a heady thrum, with vibes still a few kph away from becoming intrusive. Talking of top speed, the Desert Storm is capable of a genuine 130 Kph even as the speedo indicated 140-145 Kph on certain sections of flat out riding on the NH4. For such speeds though, sticking it on 4th gear up to 120 Kph, close to the rev limited was the norm, before shifting to fifth for the final burst of velocity. I have never been one to let go of an opportunity to ride through the twisties as straight roads simple bore me. Soon, I found myself taking the detour to Mahabaleshwar instead of heading straight onto the NH4 to Goa. On a weekday, Mahabaleshwar’s twisties are just empty enough to get a peg down and before that could happen, the center stand of the Desert Storm 500 used to kiss the ground.On the whole, the experience of the Desert Storm 500 on the twisties is something that is extremely enjoyable as the Royal Enfield loves most corners except the tightest ones. Guess, this has something to do with the motorcycle being designed in a country that has more twisted roads than straight ones, and yeah, I am talking about the United Kingdom. Going up the Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar Ghats, torque and oodles of it was what did the talking. Trust me you, if you want a motorcycle that breezes past inclines with an authoritative thump to accompany rather than screaming its bearings off, it is the Royal Enfield UCE500s you should be looking at.The availability of a diesel car like torque band across the rev range, made the Desert Storm extremely enjoyable on the hills and this is something that Ladakh goers must take note of. Effortless is the word that can sum up the way in which the Desert Storm 500 clambered up inclines with nary a sweat and this torque was indeed what came into play when overtaking later in the day. Once I hit the monsoon ravaged roads down Mahabaleshwar leading to Poladpur and the NH17, the Desert Storm 500s build quality was sorely tested. Rattles were never a concern throughout although the Desert Storm somehow felt less solidly built than the tank like build quality exhibited by my erstwhile LB500.Massive potholes later, all of them taken with no slowing down, the Desert Storm’s front fork gaiters began scraping under hard braking, in a sign of the damage done after all that hurtling across crater sized potholes. The suspension was a good compromise between firm and pliant and was almost the perfect set up for touring. This said, I got the feeling that my LB500 would have held better in such a situation although the Desert Storm’s fork gaiters exhibiting scraping could be a one off case. Other than this issue, everything stayed where it had it, remember we’re talking Bullets here, and that is actually a back handed compliment to Royal Enfield having improved putting together its motorcycles. No rattles or unseemly sounds or groans even on the day I handed over the motorcycle to Royal Enfield after 1000 Kms of hard riding will be highly appreciated by the tourers.Braking however needs real improvement as the rear brake is almost useless for most cases of retardation, and is best used as a parking brake. A disc brake set up at the rear should be on the top of Royal Enfield’s to-do list. Often I found myself banging down the gears to stop in time. Talking of which, the gearshift quality calls for positive shifting and is nowhere near to what can be termed as slick shifting. But, once you get the hang if it, false neutrals are few and far in between. The front disc though highly effective is grabby and caution needs to be exercised on dusty or wet surfaces as a handful of front brake could easily lock up the front wheel.The MRF Zapper tyres though are a vast improvement on the ribbed designs that other Bullets come with and provide decent grip on most surfaces and conditions.  Throttle response was very crisp, and this can be majorly attributed to the fuel injection that the Desert Storm’s 500cc, long stroke single cylinder engine features. Jerking is a thing of the past with the Desert Storm’s ample torque making progress in fifth gear at speeds as low as 45-50 Kph a feat achieved without any knocking or engine strain. The fuel economy that the Desert Storm 500 returned after hard riding was around 27 Kmpl and when cruising on the highways at 90-100 Kph the motorcycle managed a very creditable 30 Kpl, which for a 500cc air cooled single is no mean feat.So, a touring range of 350 Kms is what the Desert Storm will provide comfortably, with its 14 Liter tank capacity. Riding on the Indian highways is a very enjoyable experience as overtaking is a breeze with the torquey single galloping to 100 Kph from 60-70 Kph in no time. This wide spread of torque will be particularly appreciated by folks on dual carriageway highways, which still abound most of the Indian roadscape, as the Desert Storm’s 500cc engine torque delivery makes overtaking heavy vehicles a veritable breeze, even on the uphill sections as I found out on my sundown ride on the NH17. Quite frankly, this engine needs to be experienced first hand on highways to realize the true capabilities of the torque wave that you have all the way from idle to 120 kph after which progress gets a wee slower.Riding the Desert Storm on the NH17 at night with plenty of truck traffic to contend with, I was extremely pleased with the illumination the low beam provided. The great headlamp was instrumental in me enjoying the ride at night. High beam though, pointed at the tree tops thus proving more of a passing light. However, this should be sorted out with some adjustment and hence can actually turn into a positive. The mirrors however showed more of blurs than images once the speed hit over 60 Kph. So, this is something that you might need to love with as a big single, especially a non counterbalanced one, will exhibit enough vibrations to make the mirrors blur out most images at speed.If you’re looking at the Desert Storm 500 as you’re ride predominantly for the city, we’d suggest against it as the Desert Storm’s 500cc engine feels best thumping along on the highway. This motor, being an air cooled one, requires plenty of air to keep cool and the urban traffic crawls aren’t exactly what the motor enjoys. Therefore, the Desert Storm 500 would do best as highway tourer where it will feel at home both on the long straights as well as the twisties. Coming to the Desert Storm’s touring credentials, I strongly recommend that you adjust the handlebar to a lower position and change the seat to a spring-less unit as the springed unit tends to sag on long distances, causing some discomfort to the back.Folks who have adjusted the handlebar to a lower position and the seat to a springless unit have actually reported superb long distance comfort and this will perhaps be the first mod that you should do on your Desert Storm/Classic/Classic Chrome 500. Now, while that come as a surprise to everyone who feel that a Royal Enfield is a ready long distance mile mumcher right from the word go need to remember that the Classic’s ergonomics(and it shares this trait with the Desert Storm and the Chrome), is more suited for short city rides than long distance touring. Coming to the reliability of the Desert Storm over 1000 Kms of non stop ripping, I’m happy to share that the oil remained where it needs to be, inside the engine.The hydraulic tappets meant that the motorcycle’s performance remained consistent even after hard riding. On the pre-unit construction engines, such hard riding would’ve normally resulted in the tappets getting loose. The Desert Storm 500, thus can take a fair share of abuse and still perform well. This is certainly a big positive for those who like to ride their Bullets hard and fast. On the whole, the engine will require much lesser maintenance than the older versions, which means that you will spend more time on the road than at our favorite mechanic’s garage, like one of Royal Enfield’s posters at the Rider Mania aptly read, a bike on the road is better than two in the garage.Also, the chain tension remained taut while the engine got progressively smoother with the kilometers logged. The electric starter managed to start the motorcycle each time it was depressed, be it early mornings or late afternoons. I’m emphasizing all of this to indicate how reliable the Desert Storm 500 was right from the word go, across varied terrain from smooth blacktop to some very poor roads. So, the Royal Enfield Desert Storm, especially its Unit Construction Engine that runs on hydraulic tappets, is indeed a big leap for Royal Enfield and folks contemplating a motorcycle for the long and winding highways might consider this very motorcycle if high speeds of over 120 Kph and razor sharp handling is not what they’re looking for.Let’s now look at the both the positives and the negatives of the Desert Storm 500, most of which is also applicable to the Classic 500 and the Classic Chrome 500.","13540","77971","","0","Royal Enfield Desert Storm","26","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","159522","2690","9.677703","3","13","71","6","69fe32bb4bbc8bdc00ecdd5264998f8","0.06","",""

Not one to sit back and rest on its laurels, Royal Enfield has worked hard behind the scenes to add extra value to its popular thumpers.Enter the Limited Edition Desert Storm and Classic Chrome. The Desert Storm's matte, sand-coloured scheme takes you all the way back to the World War II era with its distinct, smoothened, classic silhouette looking all dressed up and ready for action. Its teardrop fuel-tank comes with thigh pads inbuilt on each side. The Classic Chrome bikes, available in maroon or black, show off their predominantly metal body thanks to a generous helping of chrome, as evident on the motorcycle's hooded headlamp, fuel tank, swooping mudguards, oval tool-box and silencer.Minor modifications have been made to Royal Enfield's present generation, fuel-injected 499cc, unit construction engine. It now gets a more powerful charging circuit as well as an improved piston assembly. The four-stroke,single-cylinder and long stroke powerplant musters 27.2bhp at 5250rpm, and 4.2kgm of torque at 4000rpm, the same as on earlier variants. Electronic ignition is offered, as are a hydraulic tappet system and automatic chain-tensioner.The chassis remains basically the same, the burly bike using a better damping rate for its spring-mounted single seat. At the front, you get a 90/90 section MRF tyre and 19-inch rim, while the rear comes with 120/80 section rubber and an 18-inch wheel.The new Classic Chrome variants are priced at R.s 1.65 lakh, Rs. 10,000 more than the Classic 500 variants, while the Desert Storm retails at Rs. 1.58 lakh, making it dearer by R.s 3,000. All prices are on-road Mumbai.","2064","12028","","0","Classic appeal","14","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","78211","607","4.916251","2","18","71","6","bcf7b09521dd7d6c5d487fccc08447d5","0.093","",""

"https://royalenfield.com/motorcycles/classic-battle-green/media-review-details/?id=2","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Royal Enfield Classic 500 - The Thump is Back!","46","382","RE comes full circle with the Classic 500The needle nudges 140. Hands tingling, I slow down to 50 and am instantly transported 10 years into the past. The slow thumping reminds me of my first partner in crime for Motorcycle Physics experiments. It all began with, of all the things, a Bullet. It refused to wheelie despite my desperate, pleading efforts. It wasn't all that fast. Not until my life depended on retardation did it feel way too fast. It was as agile as a 200 kg block of iron. Er, which it was. Sunday mornings were spent cleaning it, and being a Bullet, there was always a lot to clean on it. There was usually more oil on the outside of the engine than on the inside. I used to look at other motorcyclists' trouser bottoms and wonder why they weren't black. It seemed only natural, you see. The Classic 500 doesn't do any of these things.What you see in these pages is a Bullet too. No matter what names Royal Enfield sticks onto their bikes, they will always be called Bullets. Well, at least I will. And ever since the Classic 500's launch, I was looking forward to see how much of the Bullet essence it retains. And it pleases me no end to state that it retains what Bullets are renowned for - character. It's a misunderstood attribute, this character. Character should make a motorcycle more involving to ride, and not make it blow a fuse, loosen its tappets and leak five litres of oil every 100 kilometres, which Bullet-folk have resigned themselves to believing. The Classic 500 changes all of that.I cannot thank RE enough for making it look the way it does. I've always held that the Thunderbird's cruiser styling was not the right way to go. Enfields were always streetbikes, cafe racers and scramblers in the old days, never cruisers. The aptly named Classic is, quite simply, a thing of beauty. Close your eyes and think of a British 500 single. Isn't this what comes to mind? The right proportion of paint and chrome on those evergreen curves and lines, that high-ish exhaust pipe, single sprung seat and minimal decals make this the best-looking Bullet yet. It manages to look smashing even in that Meru cab green. An elderly gentleman ambled up to me at a traffic light and asked, 'What model? What year?' 'New model. This year,' I replied and the look on his face said it all. RE has nailed it on the head this time. The chrome is much deeper than before and paint quality is the best-ever from RE. The Look. Check. Now for the other most important thing - the thump. The beat of the 500cc worth of exiting gases is fantastic. There is no more of that noisy clatter from the engine as there was on the earlier Thunderbirds and LB 500s. The sound is almost as good as the old cast-iron engines, with the valvegear providing mild accompaniment. The Thump. Check.So, the Classic 500 retains the two most important aspects of the Bullet character. And then it adds a whole lot more to it. This is the first Enfield that does justice to the deprived upper reaches of that familiar speedometer. The new fuel-injected 499cc single-cylinder Unitary Construction Engine pumps out 27.2 bhp @ 5250 rpm and 4.21 kgm @ 4000 rpm, more than enough to keep you grinning from ear to ear. It's as smooth as a 500cc high-compression single is going to get and at no time does it feel strained.he combination of fuel injection and an integrated gearbox (no more excessive transmission lag) along with more efficient internals harness the twin spark plug engine's power pulses in manner that was alien to Bullets in the past. Throttle response is unlike any RE bike till date - immediate and precise - and power comes at you from all directions right from the word go. Now, 27 bhp actually feels like 27 bhp on the Classic 500. Which means that pops wheelies with more ease than I can hold them and spin its wheels hard, leaving long, black welts on the tarmac. Is this a Bullet?! Let that torque loose and the 500 roars to 60 kph in 3.6 seconds and breaks through the 100 kph barrier in 10 seconds. The maximum I could take the bike was to 130 kph, though there was a bit more shove left before I ran out of road. And the Classic ignored all the abuse I could dish out, remaining tight and ready to go throughout the duration of the test. Heck, not even a single misfire! My Bullet would've spat its valves out through the exhaust pipe and choked on its piston if I rode it the way I rode the Classic 500.Gearshift quality has improved and shifts have more positive feel now. Shifts are also quicker and work with the overall shorter gearing to allow the Classic 500 to accelerate like a chromed bat out of an old English town. However, false neutrals are still part of the package. But I'm not complaining. Every missed shift sent high-quality renditions of the piston's oscillations up my spine and into my brain, breaking the dam of time and bringing memories of flat-out rides flooding back. A Bullet isn't a Bullet without those vibes giving you goosebumps, is it?Enjoyable handling has always been a Bullet trait, even on my Bullet. Boy, did it corner! And the Classic 500 is even better, with its new 90/90 front and 110/90 rear 18-inch MRF Zappers that grip quite well. It loves sweepers just as much as before and has become more friendly with switchbacks. The reduced diameter of the wheels and the more rounded profile of the tyres make it flickable and it also retains the stability. Ride quality is as good as before and while overall feel has improved by a lot, it's not ideal.Our test bike had a loose steering head which resulted in a mild swaying wobble above 100 kph. Shouldn't be a problem on other bikes, though. Also, though the 280 mm front disc is powerful, there isn't much feel through the lever, which compounds the task of the front forks that feel too soft for the bike. A firmer front with more feel is what's needed here. This is the only real complaint I have with the Classic 500.  There are other things, like the flickering right-side pilot lamp, an indeterminable rattle coming from the front end, mirrors that vibrate too much to be of any use and pegs that seem to be too wide when you put your foot down. But I really don't care about these things. These are teething troubles that every Bullet comes with and are meant for you to take care of. You make it perfect the way you want it. At Rs 1,31,527, ex-showroom, Mumbai, the Classic 500 is fantastic value for money, given its Ninja 250-rivalling performance and exclusive appeal. What's more unbelievable is that I got 29.6 kpl in spite of not taking it easy even for a second! Brilliant! With a gentler right hand, you will go farther for sure. Anyway, at this price, I'd have liked to see better suspension and stickier Avon tyres too.If reminding people of the past is this bike's purpose, I'd say it's a smashing success. If being a smashing performer is this bike's purpose, I'd say it's even better. Riding the bike left me with the feeling of being back on my old Bullet. The feel, the smell and the tingling sensation that remains with you long after you've gotten off the saddle - it's all there. Just that the Classic 500 takes the experience to another plane. A Bullet that finally goes like one, looks better than a sackful of gold, has a sound that reminds one of the golden age of motorcycling and throws no tantrums? Thank you very much Royal Enfield, for the best Bullet I've ever ridden.    ","7411","42063","","0","Royal Enfield Classic 500 - The Thump is Back!","46","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","109032","1570","8.111653","2","5","61","6","5eff3146a897e8a710b49af04e3f28de","0.098","",""

From the black paint to the front drum brakes, the new Bullet 350 UCE still looks very much like the 50 year old Bullet. The Bullet 350 UCE probably doesn't have a self start even as an option (not mentioned in its tech specs).  According to me the new UCE engine gives the Bullet 350 a clean look. Visually a few sore spots on the motorcycle do remain in the form of the oddly shaped kick lever and the extra long exhaust pipe.Why did Royal Enfield replace all its models with the UCE (Unit Contruction Engine) Twin Spark?No matter how hard one might try to hold on to old tradition, changes are at times inevitable.With the BS III (Bharat Stage III being applied to all Two Wheelers sold in India) pollution norms coming in, it was not possible for Royal Enfield to comply with using the 50 plus year old, cast iron Bullet engine.  With the UCE we can expect the reliabilty to get even better and with the gears put on the left side, Royal Enfield would definitely look at getting more new bikers (""non Bulleteers"") in its fraternity.  Bullet purists might call it blasphemy, but then for someone like me who has been always fascinated by the Bullet brand but at the same time also had a mental stumbling block of the gears being on the unconventional side, this all new Royal Enfield lineup now looks more welcoming.  Maybe someday I'll ride a Royal Enfield.Royal Enfield Bullet 350 UCE, Technical SpecificationsEngine Engine Single Cylinder, Four Stroke, OHV, Air Cooled, Twinspark Displacement 346 cc Bore x Stroke 70mm x 90mm Maximum Power 19.8 bhp @ 5250 rpmMaximum Torque 28 Nm @ 4000 rpm Transmission Constant Mesh 5 speed Ignition Digital TCICarburetor Micarb VM 24Dimensions Ground Clearance 140 mm Width 810 mm Wheel Base 1370 mm Length 2140 mmHeight 1120 mm Seat Height/ Saddle Height 800 mmTyres Front 3.25 x 19""Rear 3.25 x 19""Electricals Electrical System 12 V - AC/DC Head lamp 12 V AC - 35/ 35W, HalogenBattery 12 V - 5AHTail Lamp 12 V, 21/5WBrakesFront Twin lead internal expanding drum breakeRear Foot operated, 153 mm drum Weight(Kerb): 180 kg (90% fuel + oil)","2843","16714","","0","Royal Enfield 350 UCE rides in (replaces the Bullet Standard 350)","65","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","78161","742","5.5770216","2","9","62","6","34413a213ac11ed00be05763594f5035","0.352","",""

Here are your optionsWelcome to British Iron Roulette. First, a few facts: 1. Every two minutes there’s a Bullet rider pushing his broken-down bike up a lonely road. 2. There’s usually enough oil on a Bullet’s engine for the USA to consider attacking it. 3. Bullets make their riders go weak in the knees – through endless frustrating kicks. 4. Contact Breaker points break more hearts than points. 5. Finding true happiness with a Bullet is like finding the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. 5. Bullet riders seem to find it. To them, it’s a fairytale that never ends. The new UCE Bullets have been around for a while now, and are said to change all of this – except that last part, of course. The soul of the old engine without any of its ‘quirks’, it’s said. Change, it seems, is inevitable – even for Royal Enfields. What’s more, they’re even said to be reliable and easy to maintain. Naturally, die-hard Bulleteers are outraged at this sacrilege that makes life easier for them and attracts riders of other ‘lesser’ motorcycles into their fold. I, however, welcome any change that makes REs easy to live with and decided to verify that claim. Why? Because a ’75 350 has owned me since before I was born. Let’s get down to the shooting, shall we?Bullet 350The Bullet is perhaps the motorcycle closest to my heart. So, it’s only natural that I rode it the most. For this one, the cogs of time ground to a halt in the ’50s. Even with the new engine, it manages to look suitably old-fashioned. Old-timers, the actual ones as well as the old at heart, will feel overwhelming sadness at the absence of the gear lever on the right side and the neutral finder. Their eyes will be tearful as they hear the increased mechanical clatter of the new motor. But when they ride it for three days in heavy rain without so much as a splutter, they will see the new-found reliability. They will gasp in amazement at how it feels so much lighter than the older one, even though it still weighs 180 kg. Their rattled bones will thank the new motor for its smoothness. And every time they open the tank, they will be shocked to see the amount of fuel left in it. The Bullet proves to be an easy-going and friendly motorcycle. And the best part is, nothing else has changed. That headlight nacelle still looks bloody beautiful. The front drum evokes equal proportions of nostalgia and white knuckles when you try to stop in a hurry. Ride quality is still excellent. Even though the power has increased from 18 bhp to 19.8 bhp, it still feels the same as before – which is around 4 bhp. Long story short, it still is a Bullet. It’s not the same, but it’s as close as you can get to the original one. Even the tank is still pinstriped by hand by a third-generation Bullet tank painter. His grandfather must’ve painted my bike’s tank. Some day, I shall ride my bike to the factory and meet him. The Bullet is dead. Long live the Bullet. PS: The CB points may have left the building, but the thump still lives. Just as soon as you’ve replaced that damned exhaust. Gun Match: Chrome six-shooterElectra TwinsparkThe Electra probably should’ve been honourably discharged in the last decade. But I suppose there are motorcyclists who don’t want to see the world through a sepia tint, but want the thump following them around anyway. It looks fresher than the Bullet, though I still associate the Electra with the early noughties; I wanted a silver one back then. I still do. I think it is certainly the most comfortable Enfield to ride – the ’bar is nice and high, while the seat is stepped just right. Gas-charged rear shocks make ride quality even better, while a front disc keeps your blood pressure low. For those who want a comfortable Bullet, this is it. PS: A good all-rounder. But not as evocative as the Bullet. Or as desirable as the Classic. Gun Match: Service revolverThunderbird TwinsparkAt some point, RE decided to give in to the ‘enthusiast’s’ perceptions – that RE is the H-D of India – and make this anomaly (Kyle can’t pronounce that word, by the way – he says alimony). Every time I see one of these, I can feel the ghost of Redditch turning in its grave. Bullets are meant to be dignified and charming Brits, not wannabe lazy Americans. Okay, it sells well, but I think it’s the most ungainly Enfield of them all - that ICBM exhaust really doesn’t help matters any. It is also comfortable and all of that, but I won’t let that distract me either.PS: I’ve a feeling that I wouldn’t be so mad at the Thunderbird if RE made a scrambler and a cafe racer alongside it. Then I could just ignore it, no? Gun Match: Single-shot pistol. Make that single-shot water pistol Classic 350Has got to be the best-looking Enfield made since they landed on Indian shores way back in the 1949. Um, the 500 too, that means. Just the way it looks is enough for me to start considering EMI options. Apparently, this aptly named Enfield is the one that gets the most attention in an RE showroom. And why not? With the optional upswept exhaust that flows more freely and a smaller diameter 18-inch rear, this version has the right sound and additional performance over the Bullet, the Electra and the Thunderbird. However, the rider’s seat is still a bit too flat to provide any reassuring support to your backside. And that optional pillion seat really mars those classic lines. I surely wouldn’t fit one. And then proceed to ride around with pillion footpegs sans the seat. And again, the front 19-incher is a ribbed pattern tyre – not cool for hard braking and hard cornering, no matter how many hardened Bulleteers swear by it. Just fit a better one, RE! But when it comes to build quality, thanks to the two Classics, all the other Enfields can again claim to be built like guns too. RE has got it very right with the Classic and I hope they go on to better things. Like a scrambler and a cafe racer, for instance. PS: Give us a long-termer, RE. Gun Match: S1860 Colt Army Model Classic 500500 is a nice number, no? It makes your heart race and your spine tingle (yes, it’s the vibes), and makes for a genuine hot rod of a motorcycle, I tell you. A fusion of pure beauty and brute power without peer. I’ve never seen that familiar speedo needle nail those numbers with as much aggression as on the C500. What’s even better is the way it feels like a direct descendant of the older cast-iron engine, more so than the 350 UCE – even the kick requires as much effort as the older ones! That 4.21 kgm of torque strains at the leash in your right hand. More often than not, it succeeds in breaking free. And then it runs wild until you’re left with the biggest pushrod buzz you can get this side of a locomotive. Adding to the involvement is a flaw – the front tyre is an 18-incher as opposed to the 350’s 19-incher, and that makes the front weave at anything above 90 kph. Even the stickier tyre doesn’t help. Also, even though that fuel injection system works pretty well, I’d prefer a carb feeding that stonking motor, just so I could fiddle with it no end. Despite these two niggles, the Classic 500 is a motorcycling experience that none should be deprived of. Looking at it elicits loving sighs. Plugging the throttle provokes adrenaline-fuelled howls. I can imagine going off on a long ride and alternating between the two until I run out of road. Though I’ve never ridden the original performance Enfields (the Meteors, Super Meteors and Constellations), I know that this one is the spiritual successor to them all. Now RE, give us the twins we’ve been waiting for. PS: The others might be subjective, but this is a true Royal Enfield for everyone. Sigh. Gun Match: 500 Smith & Wesson MagnumThe parting shotMy Bullet takes me back, in spite of not having been born then, to a time when the first propeller-powered planes took to the unexplored skies. A time when the only electric things around were CB-point ignitions and lightning. It’s a firm cast-iron, 350cc upper cut to the ‘progress’ that time has wreaked upon us.It’s been said that a Bullet’s tickover is the mechanical rendition of the human heartbeat. The only thing a child hears in its mother’s womb is her heartbeat. Then, it is born and soon it hears the thump of a Bullet, and it is drawn by an instinctive affection to that sound. An affection that’s been formed even before it was born. It doesn’t stand a chance. The story of every Bullet rider, it’s said. No wonder the number of people who want Bullets has never waned. Even more so today, when the forbidding reputation of older Bullets is being rapidly overhauled by these new Enfields. Okay, the gear lever’s on the wrong side and CB points have long disappeared. But a Bullet is still a Bullet. You open your heart to it and let it own you, sometimes even before you are born. And even though the new generation of Royal Enfields have made a move towards becoming more acceptable and to conform with current-day standards, they remain a happy escape, a release from the efficiency-propounding life that living in today’s world is. And notice that I didn’t even once say ‘character’.

The series translated to superb demand that, very often, far outstripped the supply. Not one to bow down to pressure, the Indian Marquee has now launched two limited edition bikes in the Classic series – the Desert Storm and Classic Chrome. The Chennai-based manufacturer has increased capacity substantially, but patrons of the veteran motorcycle maker are still bearing with long waiting periods. Royal Enfield has just rolled out its latest and we grabbed the opportunity to get astride the heavy metal thumpers on desolate Jaisalmer highways. The gleaming spokes, chrome-rimmed wheels and flowing, steel mudguards are in line with the retro aura that's been the big draw and highlight to Royal Enfield motorcycles. The Desert Storm's matte sand colour does well to embellish this and the bike looks all the better for it. The Classic Chrome, in comparison, uses dual-tone shades of chrome with maroon, or black, smart and broad stripes running along the length of its mudguards. Metal-encased telescopic forks lead to a bright, hooded headlight, sticking out from a Royal Enfield trademark steering head. Instruments are familiar bits: the basic analogue Royal Enfield fare with a speedometer reading up to 160kph. A fuel gauge is missing but you do get a reserve warning icon. Circular, chrome mirrors look the part but vibrate a fair bit when riding and hamper rearview vision. We've always recommended buffed alloy levers and the new models also have rider-friendly soft and comfortable palm grips. The switchgear, which packs all the essentials, works positively and both Enfields come equipped with strident twin horns, a well-deserved bonus for these highway friendly motorcycles. The latest Classics use teardrop fuel tanks with the Royal Enfield logo emblazoned in an aptly regal font. An old-fashioned chrome tank cap and knee-pads — on the Desert Storm — lend a period touch to the bikes as do the tool and air boxes on the flanks. Hogging the limelight of course is the large, naked engine which displays good attention to detail, with crankcase blisters inspired by the Spitfire fighter aircraft of World War II. The spring-mounted riding saddle that was part of the original Classic has been improved with revised, stiffer springs that kept us better connected to the motorcycle. Both the Desert Storm and Classic Chrome get uncluttered rear sections, their smoothly flowing mudguards leading to the tail-light. While overall quality and finish do seem slightly improved, they still lag behind the tall standard of modern Indian motorcycles. This new Classic duo come with an improved, 499cc, air-cooled, four-stroke and single-cylinder new-generation Royal Enfield engine. Twin spark-plugs and Keihin fuel injection are carry-forwards from the original Classics, as are twin valves and long-stroke engine architecture that fit this character-rich motorcycle perfectly. The piston assembly is superior, and mapping has been revised while much else remains constant including hydraulic tappets, a drive-chain tensioning system and the peak power figure of 27.2bhp at 5250rpm. 4.2kgm of max torque is delivered at 4000rpm. The big single starts at the push of a button, with its charging circuit now beefed up. As expected, the Limited Edition Classics drum out a lazy, healthy and loud beat Indians have long admired and appreciated. Pushing hard in the quest for brisk performance is pointless on these motorcycles, with unhurried riding pleasure the way to go while cautiously short-shifting through the one-down, four-up pattern, mechanical-feeling gearbox. Holding cruising speeds of up to 110kph is effortless, beyond which the Classics can still be pushed but riding pleasure severely deteriorates. The power spread is wide, with an ample low and mid-range yours for the asking. The heavy Classics provide decent throttle response and a lazy, rhythmic feel that Royal Enfields are renowned for. Performance is much the same as earlier, the Desert Storm and Classic Chrome zipping past 60kph in around four seconds, while mustering a true top speed of 130kph. The Classic Chrome and Desert Storm weigh 187kg, their single-downtube, heavy tubular steel frames reaching from a bulky steering clamp to the engine, while an archaic, tubular, bush-mounted swingarm attaches to the rear wheel and twin adjustable gas-filled shock absorbers. There's been much change in the front, where 130mm travel-telescopic front forks now run in the same line as the front wheel axle. Trail is increased to 101mm, and the front wheel is now 19 inches, even as the rear remains 18 inches shod by a larger 120/80 section tyre. The Classics have a comfortable and commanding upright riding posture, and the newly sprung seat is certainly a big improvement. Royal Enfield bikes are known for not sacrificing much handling despite a full payload, and this duo maintains that reputation. Straightline stability is always rock-solid, and these Classics go around corners with a planted feel. Steering feel is heavier than ideal but neutral and precise, with good ride quality keeping the rider comfortable over most road surfaces. Brake feel is more reassuring now, thanks to the new front suspension with a 280mm disc in the front and a 153mm drum unit at rear. While it is true that these two new models represent the best of what Royal Enfield has to offer, a swiftly evolving two-wheeler market is proving to be a stringent test to veteran motorcycle makers. Undeniably, the Classic series has come a long way from the models released two years ago, but RE must step up the pace of improvement, whilst retaining its old world charm and charisma. It won't be long before this very capable Indian manufacturer faces stiff competition from able cruiser rivals — most notably, Harley Davidson — who prepare to launch their wares in India.

Ever since its roll-out in November 2009, the Bullet Classic has quite clearly made an impact on motorcyclists' psyche, and the two new models promise to take the same effect forward. It's not just a paint and lipstick job though. We welcome the Desert Storm and the Classic 500 Chrome into the thumping Royal Enfield family!Embellishment, thy name is what sells Auto Americana by the millions, be it on two, four or 16 wheels! Custom craftsmanship, swathed in chrome and adorned with slick paintwork to make newer versions of regular production models has long been the magic mantra to spice things up and shift countless Fords, Chevys, Cadillacs, Harley-Davidsons, Caterpillars, Macks, etc out of showrooms and this practice continues unabated to this day. Of course when it is wheeled tradition which is being peddled, this line of customization at the factory level holds some esteem and residual values to the product.So if you are thinking this is pretty much the line of thought being borrowed and adopted for India by Royal Enfield you would be both wrong and right – to varying degrees! Fact one is that Royal Enfield never believed in what it could do and spent much time fretting over who their customer was – the Machismo type, the dudhwala, the lone ranger type of long distance rider, the evolved rider, the born again biker or maybe even the young dude who wants to typify cool on the move. The key to their muddled thought process was just going with gut feel as a biker and the rest would pan out. Hesitatingly the firm worked on tweaking its staple product since inception (in India of course), the Bullet but then it had to for the simple reason  that emission standards evolved and the need to stack up on technology to meet legislation saw the old push-rod lump get a sizeable makeover. The separate gearbox was junked and the unit construction engine incorporated a new 5-speed constant mesh cluster within the crankcase. From this substantially revised bottom end, the scene shifted to a twin spark plug top end job along with electronic fuel injection and the resultant 500cc motor that emerged set the new standard for what many wanted from a Bullet.Do understand that to date the Bullet has never changed in form but only in makeup and till now Royal Enfield has been spinning variants from the same armoury, never making an all-new model (but that should change in a year or so). Nothing wrong in that for when you see the bent twin iron from Harley-Davidson which goes right back to before World War II, the Bullet has just climbed the upgrade wagon, so to speak! What I am driving home is the point that Royal Enfield should not have worried for their Classic job was exactly what the market needed – a refreshing modern throwback to an era of motorcycling which can cut the mustard even today. From its roll-out just prior to Auto Expo 2010 to right now, the Classic has stumped the Royal Enfield management by accounting for over 40% of total sales for the marque and it shows no sign of petering out.Ever since its roll-out in November 2009, the Bullet Classic has quite clearly made an impact on motorcyclists’ psyche and from that point on the firm put into place a whole new programme on two fronts: get the production process upgraded from a technology and efficiency angle while planning even more upgrades to the basic product. Mind you when I tested the Classic almost two years ago, I marveled at the bike as the single biggest techno-leap Royal Enfield had ever accorded the Bullet in its long history and it showed in the way it brought forth the smiles on many faces. Heck, I wasn’t even a Bullet traditionalist, more often than not joking about them just so that I didn’t get to ride these Royal Oilfields but the Classic made me a convert – I can’t believe I am saying this! From there on I have been badgering the folks at Thiruvottiyur to further make the few decisive improvements on the bike which had not got the ‘Classic’ treatment. The rate of development pace may not have been up to Ninja or Fireblade speed, but given the wafting pleasure of a Bullet in its element, the new Classic introduced this week packs in a small raft of improvements in hardware and software which have yet again honed the calibre of this long standing gun on two-wheels for the better.First a mention about the new variants, or to be precise the new models which will now constitute the 500cc Classic range. To be turned out in two distinctly different liveries, the first one is the Classic Chrome version which is resplendent in the traditional Brit bike turnout of yore with a painted and chromed tank, the same theme being carried over lengthwise on the two mudguards. Again in this variant there is a choice of maroon or black to go with the chrome and the Classic in this traditional stance does look dishy. The second variant is one which harks towards the Bullet being the defender emeritus via its links to the armed forces and it’s decked out in a khaki matt finish throughout. This unusual is also brilliantly turned out with tiny rubber knee guards on both sides of the petrol tank  to give the machine a period aura which only goes on to emphasise the overall charm of the package no end. The badging on both variants is the traditional Royal Enfield script and the medley of retro style overtones with modern tech essentially massaging ‘old’ muscle makes for a heady concoction.One doesn’t buy a Classic or for that matter a Bullet to trip the light fantastic or out drag Hayabusas and its ilk but to deliver a most pleasurable ride where the exhaust beats can be heard at the convenient rate of one every other telegraph pole! No wonder it is the epitome of relaxed adventurers but with newer converts to the Bullet’s wholly non-violent cause, Royal Enfield knew that if there were some nut cases out to extract and use every iota of the 27.2bhp the long stroke 499cc single produces, they needed to give better control and stability to the package.This was what I had mentioned in my report from two years ago, especially calling for the front fork to be junked with modern internals allied to revised rake and trail. The earlier Classic with the added thump from its fuel injected twin spark motor had a new found urge to gallop but the handling stability, especially under braking made the front wheel hop and skip and this did detract from the other gains made on the Bullet platform. Nothing would have happened had the powerful front disc not clamped so well, twisting the archaic forks beyond their capability so something was needed to be done, and soon.The boffins at Royal Enfield took this to heart and have a completely new front fork and revised geometry for the 2012 Classic range in focus here. To the unsuspecting eye this may yet look the same but peer close and you see that the forks (built by Endurance who also provide the rear gas charged shock absorbers) act directly on the axle and even though their housings remain yet in the traditional retro style, the internals and their construction are all new. The revised geometry this brings in its adoption sees the trail hiked to 101.49mm from the previous 72.54mm while the centre shift of the forks measure 26mm at a rake angle of 26.09 degrees.So much for the number crunching but moving on to the placement of this directly on the axle has meant a positive shift in the weight distribution plus also the ability to soak up braking forces without affecting the directional stability of the machine. There is much more poise, more ease and generally a much calmer approach when hitting the anchors. In fact the Royal Enfield engineers went back into history to revert back to a 19-inch front wheel, junking the 90/90-18 tyre for a 90/90-19 unit. The good thing is that this entire revised front end set-up works a treat and the near neutral handling ability colludes well with the overall character of this machine to make it a pleasure ride every time one swings a leg over its minimalist single seat and hits the road. The rear tyre is also changed, a slightly wider 120/80-18 unit coming in place of the 110/90-18 detail on the original Classic.While the new front forks and larger diameter wheel up front constitutes the main detail changes on the 2012 Classics, there are some important tweaks elsewhere on the machine. One of these is the new mapping of the electronic fuel injection system, the Royal Enfield engine men worked with Japanese fuel equipment supplier Keihin to make for a much smoother power delivery without sacrificing any of the crisp response (in relation to the pre-Classic Bullets) which has been just as much of a revelation in the smiles-per-hour stake as has been the overall pleasure factor in the ownership experience.Make no mistake about it, as I have mentioned earlier, the Bullet Classics are a throwback to a different era of motorcycling long lost to us but just as relevant among a section of motorcyclist which is going fast forward into the past and enjoying every second of this journey. To try and convince us hard-nosed journos and disbelievers, the firm organized an exclusive ride in what was supposed to be sandy desert wastes in and around Jaisalmer. Based at the uber exclusive resort, The Serai, we spent a day and a half exploring a Rajasthan with good tarmac, some sandy stretches to put the woollies in one’s stomach and acres and acres of greenery! Yes the strong monsoon this year had changed the golden yellow desert landscape into a lush green forest with strong shrubbery and trees making for a surreal base to ride what are essentially two-wheeled blasts from the past albeit with a very promising future.The essence of the Classic is massaging the ego and let me tell you that I was beaming all throughout the ample time I spent on the saddle riding through brush, sand and tarmac. Of course having a lazily spinning long stroke mill made things so very easy but let us also factor in the silky smooth fuelling which made things so very pleasurable. Many mention a drive in a Rolls-Royce being akin to wafting at speed on a carpet of air, well one can say the same thing about wafting for pleasure and the Classic delivers in bucket loads. The controls have improved greatly and the clutch plus the shifter mechanism for the 5-speed constant mesh ’box add their own to the pleasure quotient. The biggest thrill is to whack open the throttle in third and give the bike its head on an open stretch. The strong torque takes over and like a tractor the big bike pulls hard and strong. I did that many times over and over and there was a crazy reason for that – no I wasn’t trying to break the engine but something just didn’t feel right.The abject reduction in vibes at the handlebar level and also at the footpegs was what really induced me to gun the big mill but there it was, a new facet to the Bullet legend, and a welcome one at that. I don’t know if this is good or bad for the traditional Bulleteers who could have used the vibes to massage their manlihood, at least while bench racing each other at the pub and by and large shooting the breeze!Getting back to reality though, the new-for-2012 Classic range gets a big thumbs up for slight detail changes which bump up the pleasure aspect manifold.  Of course there is a premium on pleasure and the Classic Chrome will be yours for Rs. 1,65,400, the Classic Desert Storm is the more appealing proposition at Rs. 1,58,200 (prices, ex-showroom Mumbai). However, one has to see these bikes in a totally different perspective and that is for their slow spinning high torque rideability where watching the scenery, and savouring it,  while you ride are as important a criterion as getting to one’s destination taking the long way around. The small band of merry Bulleteers at Royal Enfield – honest there finally are bikers at the helm of affairs steering the firm – led by Dr Venki Padmanabhan with support from motorcycle industry veteran R L Ravichandran plus the diehard support of long standing Bullet and motorcycling aficionado Siddharth Lal, means that more is in store for the marquee and from the marque. What shape and form it will take is still in the concept stage but rest assured, on the strength of understanding the neo-retro motorcycle segment and marrying it to customer preferences in the here and now, Royal Enfield seems to have just about managed to get a handle on things. Now let’s see many more new variants on the Bullet theme ram home!ROYAL ENFIELD: The Future Ahead!In its near 65 year plus history in the Indian market, Royal Enfield has been propped up almost single-handedly by the Bullet, majorly in 350cc displacement and only in the past decade has it made the welcome move to a half litre machine. While the venerable Chennai-based firm did attempt to do other bikes, none of these (the Enfield 200 with a Villiers-two-stroke engine, the Fantabulous scooter which predated the swing-open rear cowl of the Honda Activa by a good four decades and the Zundapp range of 50cc, 60cc, 75cc and 175cc motorcycles) have enjoyed such a long lease of life as has the Bullet. The Thunderbird cruiser was a major departure for the Bullet and for a while it did open up an altogether new vista for the traditional Bullet customer before the Classic brought it all back together in the nicest possible manner from late 2009 onwards.At Auto Expo 2010, Royal Enfield had shown another take on the basic Bullet theme, this being the Café Racer concept. I think this is next on the anvil even though I for one have mixed feelings regarding its tank design which is intrinsic a part of any motorcycle’s visual appeal and standing. I think a typical period scrambler would also be a very good niche product for Royal Enfield to emulate and this would go just right with the engine characteristics the Classic is endowed with.However, bits and pieces are exactly what Royal Enfield has been resorting to for a long time but the time has now come when it needs to unshackle itself from its conservative streak and come out boldly with an all new machine. In fact, this would help it because the retro-classic style has a lot going for it and with some nifty moves the company could do well to have a twin-cylinder machine join its line-up. This twin could spawn a modular engine family with varying engine capacities from say 450cc to 750cc and housed in different chassis to come up with a range of models. The time has also come to think about overhead cam motors, be it single or twin cam with two or three or four valves per cylinder. The writing is on the walls for a move into the ohc space and multiple valves, if only thanks to the prospect of staying on the right side of tail pipe legislation or the horrible spectre of being overwhelmed by it. Siddharth Lal and team have been discussing parallel twins, vee-twins and what have you, the company is in sound financial health and an all new modern manufacturing facility is also coming up within the next few months. What is needed is clarity of purpose and a gut feel to doing great motorcycles. The Classic was born out of that line of thought but now they need to go the whole hog – lock, stock and gun barrel if they are not just to stay relevant but also take a leaf out of the Harley and Triumph way of retro biking taking to the back of beyond successfully. Motorcycling’s oldest bike maker needs these decisive steps and the fear of success shouldn’t deter them from putting their best feet forward to the task. Fire away Sid and gang!","15658","89753","","0","Royal Enfield Bullet Classic 2.0 : First Ride","45","1800 210 0007 (9 AM - 9 PM)","27","nearest dealer","14","nearest service center","22","","","","174319","3072","10.075289","3","16","71","6","3db00d3ad487963d16fd07ca1d20a5b9","0.062","",""

"https://royalenfield.com/motorcycles/bullet-350/media-review-details/?id=35","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Royal Enfields compared - Bullet proof","38","306","Which bullet would you shoot yourself with? Here are your optionsWelcome to British Iron Roulette. First, a few facts: 1. Every two minutes there’s a Bullet rider pushing his broken-down bike up a lonely road. 2. There’s usually enough oil on a Bullet’s engine for the USA to consider attacking it. 3. Bullets make their riders go weak in the knees – through endless frustrating kicks. 4. Contact Breaker points break more hearts than points. 5. Finding true happiness with a Bullet is like finding the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. 5. Bullet riders seem to find it. To them, it’s a fairytale that never ends. The new UCE Bullets have been around for a while now, and are said to change all of this – except that last part, of course. The soul of the old engine without any of its ‘quirks’, it’s said. Change, it seems, is inevitable – even for Royal Enfields. What’s more, they’re even said to be reliable and easy to maintain. Naturally, die-hard Bulleteers are outraged at this sacrilege that makes life easier for them and attracts riders of other ‘lesser’ motorcycles into their fold. I, however, welcome any change that makes REs easy to live with and decided to verify that claim. Why? Because a ’75 350 has owned me since before I was born. Let’s get down to the shooting, shall we?Bullet 350The Bullet is perhaps the motorcycle closest to my heart. So, it’s only natural that I rode it the most. For this one, the cogs of time ground to a halt in the ’50s. Even with the new engine, it manages to look suitably old-fashioned. Old-timers, the actual ones as well as the old at heart, will feel overwhelming sadness at the absence of the gear lever on the right side and the neutral finder. Their eyes will be tearful as they hear the increased mechanical clatter of the new motor. But when they ride it for three days in heavy rain without so much as a splutter, they will see the new-found reliability. They will gasp in amazement at how it feels so much lighter than the older one, even though it still weighs 180 kg. Their rattled bones will thank the new motor for its smoothness. And every time they open the tank, they will be shocked to see the amount of fuel left in it. The Bullet proves to be an easy-going and friendly motorcycle. And the best part is, nothing else has changed. That headlight nacelle still looks bloody beautiful. The front drum evokes equal proportions of nostalgia and white knuckles when you try to stop in a hurry. Ride quality is still excellent. Even though the power has increased from 18 bhp to 19.8 bhp, it still feels the same as before – which is around 4 bhp. Long story short, it still is a Bullet. It’s not the same, but it’s as close as you can get to the original one. Even the tank is still pinstriped by hand by a third-generation Bullet tank painter. His grandfather must’ve painted my bike’s tank. Some day, I shall ride my bike to the factory and meet him. The Bullet is dead. Long live the Bullet. PS: The CB points may have left the building, but the thump still lives. Just as soon as you’ve replaced that damned exhaust. Gun Match: Chrome six-shooterElectra TwinsparkThe Electra probably should’ve been honourably discharged in the last decade. But I suppose there are motorcyclists who don’t want to see the world through a sepia tint, but want the thump following them around anyway. It looks fresher than the Bullet, though I still associate the Electra with the early noughties; I wanted a silver one back then. I still do. I think it is certainly the most comfortable Enfield to ride – the ’bar is nice and high, while the seat is stepped just right. Gas-charged rear shocks make ride quality even better, while a front disc keeps your blood pressure low. For those who want a comfortable Bullet, this is it. PS: A good all-rounder. But not as evocative as the Bullet. Or as desirable as the Classic. Gun Match: Service revolverThunderbird TwinsparkAt some point, RE decided to give in to the ‘enthusiast’s’ perceptions – that RE is the H-D of India – and make this anomaly (Kyle can’t pronounce that word, by the way – he says alimony). Every time I see one of these, I can feel the ghost of Redditch turning in its grave. Bullets are meant to be dignified and charming Brits, not wannabe lazy Americans. Okay, it sells well, but I think it’s the most ungainly Enfield of them all - that ICBM exhaust really doesn’t help matters any. It is also comfortable and all of that, but I won’t let that distract me either.PS: I’ve a feeling that I wouldn’t be so mad at the Thunderbird if RE made a scrambler and a cafe racer alongside it. Then I could just ignore it, no? Gun Match: Single-shot pistol. Make that single-shot water pistol Classic 350Has got to be the best-looking Enfield made since they landed on Indian shores way back in the 1949. Um, the 500 too, that means. Just the way it looks is enough for me to start considering EMI options. Apparently, this aptly named Enfield is the one that gets the most attention in an RE showroom. And why not? With the optional upswept exhaust that flows more freely and a smaller diameter 18-inch rear, this version has the right sound and additional performance over the Bullet, the Electra and the Thunderbird. However, the rider’s seat is still a bit too flat to provide any reassuring support to your backside. And that optional pillion seat really mars those classic lines. I surely wouldn’t fit one. And then proceed to ride around with pillion footpegs sans the seat. And again, the front 19-incher is a ribbed pattern tyre – not cool for hard braking and hard cornering, no matter how many hardened Bulleteers swear by it. Just fit a better one, RE! But when it comes to build quality, thanks to the two Classics, all the other Enfields can again claim to be built like guns too. RE has got it very right with the Classic and I hope they go on to better things. Like a scrambler and a cafe racer, for instance. PS: Give us a long-termer, RE. Gun Match: S1860 Colt Army Model Classic 500500 is a nice number, no? It makes your heart race and your spine tingle (yes, it’s the vibes), and makes for a genuine hot rod of a motorcycle, I tell you. A fusion of pure beauty and brute power without peer. I’ve never seen that familiar speedo needle nail those numbers with as much aggression as on the C500. What’s even better is the way it feels like a direct descendant of the older cast-iron engine, more so than the 350 UCE – even the kick requires as much effort as the older ones! That 4.21 kgm of torque strains at the leash in your right hand. More often than not, it succeeds in breaking free. And then it runs wild until you’re left with the biggest pushrod buzz you can get this side of a locomotive. Adding to the involvement is a flaw – the front tyre is an 18-incher as opposed to the 350’s 19-incher, and that makes the front weave at anything above 90 kph. Even the stickier tyre doesn’t help. Also, even though that fuel injection system works pretty well, I’d prefer a carb feeding that stonking motor, just so I could fiddle with it no end. Despite these two niggles, the Classic 500 is a motorcycling experience that none should be deprived of. Looking at it elicits loving sighs. Plugging the throttle provokes adrenaline-fuelled howls. I can imagine going off on a long ride and alternating between the two until I run out of road. Though I’ve never ridden the original performance Enfields (the Meteors, Super Meteors and Constellations), I know that this one is the spiritual successor to them all. Now RE, give us the twins we’ve been waiting for. PS: The others might be subjective, but this is a true Royal Enfield for everyone. Sigh. Gun Match: 500 Smith & Wesson MagnumThe parting shotMy Bullet takes me back, in spite of not having been born then, to a time when the first propeller-powered planes took to the unexplored skies. A time when the only electric things around were CB-point ignitions and lightning. It’s a firm cast-iron, 350cc upper cut to the ‘progress’ that time has wreaked upon us.It’s been said that a Bullet’s tickover is the mechanical rendition of the human heartbeat. The only thing a child hears in its mother’s womb is her heartbeat. Then, it is born and soon it hears the thump of a Bullet, and it is drawn by an instinctive affection to that sound. An affection that’s been formed even before it was born. It doesn’t stand a chance. The story of every Bullet rider, it’s said. No wonder the number of people who want Bullets has never waned. Even more so today, when the forbidding reputation of older Bullets is being rapidly overhauled by these new Enfields. Okay, the gear lever’s on the wrong side and CB points have long disappeared. But a Bullet is still a Bullet. You open your heart to it and let it own you, sometimes even before you are born. And even though the new generation of Royal Enfields have made a move towards becoming more acceptable and to conform with current-day standards, they remain a happy escape, a release from the efficiency-propounding life that living in today’s world is. And notice that I didn’t even once say ‘character’.
